### Tutorial Meeting (16th Mar)
Laurence did not attend this meeting and did not send an email in advance. He later sent an apology as he got caught up writing solution worksheets for another module and simply forgot about the meeting.
In his absence we did go through a few things from last weeks meeting.

### Group Meeting (20th Mar)
Connor went through the overall structure of the code so that the entire group understood what was happening at all places, that way when we have implementation week we can help with the code in any place.
