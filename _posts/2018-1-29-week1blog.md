title: Week 1 (29th Jan - 4th Feb)
---
So I finally got the blog up and running for the Software Engineering Group Project.
I chose to set up my blog using Github Pages and Jekyll. [This is a link to the Github Repository I used, it contains a small walkthrough on how to set up the blog.](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) I could have used my first year WordPress blog, just delete the old posts and redo the about pages and such but I chose Github three two main reasons.

* That domain eventually runs out when I leave university as it is hosted by the university. I would like to keep this blog for longer as I might find uses for it later down the line.
* Using Github instead of WordPress allows me to get used to Github more in general using things such as forks and markups. This is generally good practice and could come in useful in the future.
* I have the option to clone my website to a local repository and get more practice with pushing and committing which again is good practice.

In regards to the Group Project, I missed the first Tutorial meeting as I was away at FOSDEM Friday - Tuesday. Due to this I was assigned the role of QA Testing along with Jack and Taylor but this is only for the given week. As I have not been to the meeting I don't have much more to write about this first week. I will cover the project more indepth in the next post when I have a permanent role in the group.
