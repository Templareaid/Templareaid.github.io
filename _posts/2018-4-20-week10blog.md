title: Week 10 (20th Apr - 26th Apr)

### Tutorial Meeting (20th Apr)
During this tutorial we basically went over the same things we had gone over in the week 8 meeting before the holidays, that being what was happening during integration week, what to expect, where we would camp for the week and what our aims would be.
By this point we had basically finished the program with a small list of things left to implement.

### Group Meeting (24th Apr)
There was no group meeting this week.

### Weeks Work
My work was to do some more jUnit testing however I found that module testing was basically done by Connor during development as laid out in SE.QA.06 and so everything that had been implemented was working. If it wasn't working properly it simply wasn't added to the system build until it was fully operational. This left me with very little work to do as I could not test systems that had not even been implemented yet. Everything that was already implemented worked according to the Test Specs.

### Other Topics
