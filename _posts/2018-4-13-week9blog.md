title: Week 9 (13th Apr - 19th Apr)
---

### Tutorial Meeting (13th Apr)
There was no meeting this week as the 13th was during our holidays.

### Group Meeting (17th Apr)
For the first week back we did not have a meeting as most people had focused on other assignments over easter and for this week as well they would still be focusing on said assignments. Due to this no progress had really been made and so there was no reason for a meeting.

### Weeks Work
During this week I did no work on the software engineering project as this was my last week to work on the Robotics assignment that was in for the 24th and so I spent my time in the ISL.

### Other Topics
No other topics for this week.

### Time
* Time this week: 0
* Total: 36
