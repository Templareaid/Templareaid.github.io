### Tutorial Meeting (23rd Feb)
This weeks tutorial meeting was over in a short space of time due to many of the tasks being completed on time thus putting the group ahead of schedule.
The first matter was around the Hash Map, the dictionary took 670ms to load which is within the Functional Requirements of under a second. This is compared to the linear search which took 250ms to load in the dictionary. However all actions that used the dictionary after the Hash Map had loaded were instant and so it was concluded that the Hash Map would be the better solution.
