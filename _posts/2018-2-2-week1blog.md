title: Week 1 (2nd Feb - 8th Feb)
---
So I finally got the blog up and running for the Software Engineering Group Project.
I chose to set up my blog using Github Pages and Jekyll. [This is a link to the Github Repository I used, it contains a small walkthrough on how to set up the blog.](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) I could have used my first year WordPress blog, just delete the old posts and redo the about pages and such but I chose Github three two main reasons.

* That domain eventually runs out when I leave university as it is hosted by the university. I would like to keep this blog for longer as I might find uses for it later down the line.
* Using Github instead of WordPress allows me to get used to Github more in general using things such as forks and markups. This is generally good practice and could come in useful in the future.
* I have the option to clone my website to a local repository and get more practice with pushing and committing which again is good practice.

Following this blog I will try and stick to a set format and standard in how they are written.

* What happened in the previous time tabled meeting
* what happened in the previous group meeting
* Write about what I personally did this week
* Lastly discuss any outlying topics

### Tutorial Meeting
In regards to the Group Project, I missed the first Tutorial meeting as I was away at FOSDEM Friday - Tuesday. Due to this I was assigned the role of QA Testing along with Jack and Taylor but this is only for the given week. As I have not been to the meeting I don't have much more to write about this first week. I will cover the project more indepth in the next post when I have a permanent role in the group.

### Group Meeting
As a group we had our first non-timetabled meeting on the 7th of Feb. The first matter was revolving around everyone having set up their blog and email the link to Lawrence. Next Taylor and Rhys discussed the testing docymentation and what they had done so far. As I had not been present and was unaware I was given the role of testing and I only got back from FOSDEM the day before our meeting I had nothing to contribute.
Matters discussed were the UI problems, how the user will input words, the display of the main menu and high scores and finally each member was to carry on the tasks they had been set in the previous meeting.

### Weeks Work
For the first week I was mostly playing catch up, catching up on lectures I had missed and reading up on the documents for the project such as the requirements, QA, Testing etc.

### Other Topics
No other topics to write about this week.
