title: Week 7 (20th Apr - 26th Apr)
---

### Tutorial Meeting (20th Apr)
I have to write more jUnit tests for when integration week starts as we have not been using them so far.

### Group Meeting (24th Apr)
There was no meeting this week as most people had been working on other assignments and there was not much to say as not very little had been done over the easter break.

### Weeks Work
I had no set work this week as Connor was uploading a list of things that need doing and we were to simply pick one from said list to work on.

### Other Topics
No other topics for this week.

### Time
* Time this week: 0
* Total: 34
