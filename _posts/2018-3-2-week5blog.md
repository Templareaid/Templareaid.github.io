title: Week 5 (2nd Mar - 8th Mar)

### Tutorial Meeting (2rd Mar)
There was no meeting this week as the weather on Friday was bad enough to close the University down for the day.

### Group Meeting (6th Mar)
Matt was not present in this meeting and had not told me that the UI demo was complete so the group decided that it was now officially finished and I could move onto testing it. The test spec was also rewritten in LaTeX so now any changes I make to it will have to be made in the LaTeX format.
We also discussed whether or not we should use FXML rather than JavaFX which we had recently switched to.

### Weeks Work
My job this week was to go over the test spec doucment and make changes based on the feedback we received from Chris. I however did not get round to doing any work this week I spent my free time doing my AI Assignment.

### Other Topics
No other topics for this week.
