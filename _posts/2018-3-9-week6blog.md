title: Week 6 (9th Mar - 15th Mar)

### Tutorial Meeting (9th Mar)
We decided in this weeks meeting that we will be switching from JavaFX to FXML however Monte also mentioned the use of a program called Scene Builder which would create the Skeleton of the FXML that could then be sent to him.
I also had not done a blog entry for the week prior as I had been busy with the AI assignment and so was to write it ASAP.
We have also found a Java Standards Document that is roughly 700 pages long that is being read by Rhys, Taylor and Jack so they can condense it down for when implementation week comes.

### Group Meeting (13th Mar)
We quickly went over the feedback we had been given from Chris about test 16 and whether the game is controller using mouse or keyboard. We decided we will email Chris about it as he specified in a previous email it has to be mouse or keyboard but not both. We picked mouse control but he then said the test should test both. So this needs clarifying.
This week Connor has updated the doc that contains what small coding jobs are available. I have been given the job of "comparing score with best highscores and updating the best highscore list if score should be in the list", and writing some jUnit tests some time in the future. Once I have done this I will have to write it up in the design document.

### Weeks Work
This week I fixed the Test Spec based on feedback from Chris. This involved fixing tests 11, 12, 13 making them specify they are repeatable and moved the FR3 tests to happen after FR6 i.e. test the loading function after the save function as the user would have nothing to load if nothing previous has been saved.
I have also started a small amount of work on the high score list.
