### Tutorial Meeting (9th Mar)
We decided in this weeks meeting that we will be switching from JavaFX to FXML however Monte also mentioned the use of a program called Scene Builder which would create the Skeleton of the FXML that could then be sent to him.
I also had not done a blog entry for the week prior as I had been busy with the AI assignment and so was to write it ASAP.
We have also found a Java Standards Document that is roughly 700 pages long that is being read by Rhys, Taylor and Jack so they can condense it down for when implementation week comes.
