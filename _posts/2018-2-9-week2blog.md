### Tutorial Meeting (9th Feb)
For the second week I attended the tutorial meeting on the Friday, which Laurence was absent from and Andy Starr was covering. Currently the tasks assigned to each member seem to be reasonable and progress is going well, the main stumbling block seems to be in the form of deciding how best to display and visualise the cube we will use in the Joggle game. The perspective is casuing some confusion and the group will need to agree on a set way to display the cube when talking about it to avoid confusion. For instance some members thought the cube was split into 3 layers with these representing the top, middle and bottom whilst others thought it was representing the front, middle and back.

New reports are set to be done for next meeting with these being:
FIrstly everyone must be given roles to streamline the work load and give each member of the group a permanent responsibility to oversee. This was to be done in our group meeting.
Monte to report on ways to implement the timer as it was understood that it's implementation was going to be difficult.
Alice and Connor are to find a way to implement tile proximity of the cube as this was also seen to be difficult.
Sam and Matthew are to discuss and clarify the UI, specifically how to represent the cube as mentioned earier.
I was to read through the testing document as I was still technically assigned this role until the group meeting and the QA 0.3 document as well.
I personally have been given the task to read through QA.03 and provide a small report on it's contents and how it relates to the project going forward so we may assign roles at the group meeting.

### Group Meeting (14th Feb)
In the group meeting roles were assigned to each member:

* Project Manager - Rhys
* Quality Assurance - Taylor
* System Designer - Connor
* Programmers - Matthew, Alice
* Testing - Aidan
* Maintainence - Jack
* End-of-project Report - Sam
* Spike Work - Monte

Monte gave a report on the timer and is working on getting it running in parallel with the rest of the program.
Alice and Connor to report on tile proximity, holding possible moves in a hashmap rather than using if statements, group was undecided on which would be simpler.
Sam and Matthew decided that the cube will be displayed as Front, Middle and Back for UI purposes.

### Weeks Works
People have also been given permanent roles now, with myself being on testing. As Taylor already had a draft for the testing document I was simply waiting on that. In the mean time I familiarised myself with the Testing Document again as well as the Requirements for the project.

### Other Topics
No other topics for this week.

### Time
* Time this week: 3
